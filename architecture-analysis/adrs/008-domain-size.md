# ADR-008: Domain Size Classification Thresholds

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

As the system grows, some domains tend to accumulate responsibilities faster
than others. Unchecked growth leads to oversized domains that are harder to
reason about, test, and evolve, and that often become architectural bottlenecks.

To make domain growth explicit and measurable, domains are classified according
to their relative size within the codebase. Size is treated as a **risk
indicator**, not a quality metric: larger domains require stronger justification
and closer scrutiny.

Rather than relying on subjective assessments, a simple and deterministic
classification rule is applied uniformly across all domains.

## Decision

Domains are classified based on their **relative size percentage** according to
the following thresholds:

- **GOOD**
  - Domain size is **≤ 30%** of the measured baseline.
  - Indicates a well-scoped and contained domain.

- **OK**
  - Domain size is **> 30% and ≤ 50%**.
  - Indicates moderate growth that should be monitored.

- **FAIL**
  - Domain size is **> 50%**.
  - Indicates an oversized domain and a high risk of change amplification and
    architectural erosion.

Additional rules:

- Classification is evaluated per domain, not globally.
- Domains classified as FAIL must be reviewed before accepting further growth.
- Size classification is independent of test coverage and does not replace
  testability requirements defined in other ADRs.

## Consequences

- Domain growth becomes visible and measurable.
- Oversized domains are flagged early through automation.
- Encourages intentional domain boundaries and decomposition.
- Provides objective signals for refactoring or domain splitting.
- Enables metrics such as:
  - distribution of domain sizes
  - growth trends per domain
  - correlation between domain size and change amplification
