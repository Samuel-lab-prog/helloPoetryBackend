# ADR-001: Domain Driven Design Structure

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

The codebase is organized around business domains (e.g. users-management,
authentication, poems-management) instead of technical layers.

This structure aims to reduce coupling, improve change locality, and make
architectural boundaries explicit. By separting into domains, we can better
manage complexity and enable teams to work independently on different areas of
the system.

Each domain can have its own internal structure and dependencies, but
cross-domain interactions must be explicit and controlled through ports and
adapters. This promotes a clear separation of concerns and allows for better
maintainability and scalability as the system evolves.

## Decision

- All source code must belong to a domain or a generic subdomain or a shared
  subdomain.
- Cross-domain dependencies are severely discouraged and must be explicitly
  justified and documented.
- Generic subdomains (e.g. utils, persistence) must not depend on business
  domains.

## Consequences

- Some duplication across domains may occur.
- Teams can work more independently on different domains, reducing coordination
  overhead.
- Domain boundaries are easier to reason about and measure.
- Enables architectural metrics such as domain isolation and size.
