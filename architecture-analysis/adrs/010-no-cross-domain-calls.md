# ADR-010: Prohibition of Cross-Domain Calls

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

In a domain-based architecture, domains are intended to be cohesive and
independently evolvable units. Direct calls between domains introduce hidden
coupling, blur ownership boundaries, and significantly increase change
amplification.

When cross-domain calls are allowed implicitly, architectural erosion tends to
occur silently, making it difficult to reason about dependencies and system
behavior.

To preserve domain isolation and enforce explicit communication boundaries,
cross-domain calls must be prohibited and automatically detected.

## Decision

- Direct calls between domains are **not allowed**.
- Any detected cross-domain call must be treated as an architectural violation.
- The CI pipeline **must fail** if cross-domain calls are detected.
- Legitimate cross-domain interactions must be:
  - mediated through explicit interfaces, or
  - relocated to a higher-level orchestration layer.

This rule is enforced by automated dependency analysis.

## Consequences

- Domain boundaries remain explicit and enforceable.
- Accidental coupling is detected early.
- Refactoring across domains becomes safer and more predictable.
- Some duplication across domains may increase.
- Enables architectural metrics such as:
  - number of cross-domain calls
  - change amplification due to cross-domain dependencies
