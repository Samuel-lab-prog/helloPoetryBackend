# ADR-014: Mandatory Domain Directory Presence

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Domains are first-class architectural units and must have a concrete presence in
the filesystem. Missing or partially defined domain directories often signal
incomplete implementations, abandoned designs, or accidental deletions.

To ensure architectural consistency, all expected domain directories must exist.

## Decision

- All declared domains must have their corresponding directories present.
- Missing domain directories are considered an architectural violation.
- The CI pipeline **must fail** when missing directories are detected.

This rule is enforced through automated analysis of the filesystem.

## Consequences

- Prevents silent architectural drift.
- Ensures declared domains are structurally complete.
- Improves reliability of tooling and metrics.
- Some initial effort may be required to create missing directories for existing
  domains.
