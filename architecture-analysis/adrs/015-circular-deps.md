# ADR-015: Prohibition of Circular Dependencies

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Circular dependencies introduce strong coupling between modules and make the
codebase harder to understand, test, and evolve. When two or more components
depend on each other directly or indirectly, it becomes difficult to reason
about change impact and dependency direction.

In a domain-oriented architecture, circular dependencies often indicate
violations of layering rules, unclear ownership, or misplaced responsibilities.
Left unchecked, they lead to fragile systems and architectural deadlocks.

To preserve architectural clarity and maintainability, circular dependencies
must be explicitly forbidden.

## Decision

- Circular dependencies are **not allowed** at any level of the system.
- Both direct and indirect dependency cycles are considered violations.
- The CI pipeline **must fail** if circular dependencies are detected.
- Detected cycles must be resolved by:
  - extracting shared abstractions,
  - inverting dependencies, or
  - restructuring responsibilities.

This rule is enforced through automated dependency analysis.

## Consequences

- Dependency graphs remain acyclic and easier to reason about.
- Change impact becomes more predictable.
- Encourages clearer ownership and responsibility boundaries.
- Prevents architectural deadlocks and hidden coupling.
