# ADR-017: Mandatory Code Formatting

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Inconsistent formatting introduces unnecessary noise in code reviews and creates
friction between contributors. Manual formatting decisions are subjective and
tend to vary between developers and domains.

Automated formatting removes stylistic debates and ensures a uniform appearance
across the entire codebase.

To maintain consistency and reduce review overhead, code formatting must be
automated and enforced.

## Decision

- All source code must follow the configured automated formatter.
- Formatting must be deterministic and tool-driven.
- Formatting checks are part of CI and **must block merges** on failure.
- Manual formatting conventions are not allowed when they conflict with the
  formatter.

## Consequences

- Eliminates formatting discussions during reviews.
- Produces consistent diffs and cleaner version history.
- Reduces developer friction over stylistic preferences.
- Requires contributors to adopt formatter tooling locally.
- May require initial setup and configuration of formatting tools for existing
  codebases.
