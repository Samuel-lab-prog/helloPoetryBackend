    # ADR-009: Distance-from-Main Classification

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

In a domain-oriented architecture, business logic is expected to be isolated
from entry points, frameworks, and infrastructural concerns. Code that is closer
to the application entry points (e.g. main modules, bootstrap logic,
controllers) is more exposed to volatility and change.

As code moves farther away from the main entry points, it generally becomes more
stable, reusable, and easier to reason about. Measuring this “distance from
main” provides a useful proxy for assessing architectural health and layering
discipline.

To make this concept actionable and enforceable, domains are classified based on
how close they are to the main entry points of the system.

## Decision

Domains are classified according to their **distance from the main entry
points**, expressed as a normalized value between 0 and 1, using the following
thresholds:

- **GOOD**
  - Distance from main is **≤ 25%**.
  - Indicates that the domain is well isolated from entry points and
    infrastructural concerns.

- **OK**
  - Distance from main is **> 25% and ≤ 50%**.
  - Indicates partial isolation and acceptable coupling.

- **FAIL**
  - Distance from main is **> 50%**.
  - Indicates excessive proximity to entry points and a high risk of instability
    and change propagation.

## Additional Rules

- Distance is measured per domain, not globally.
- This metric complements, but does not replace, other architectural constraints
  such as domain isolation and testability.
- Domains classified as FAIL must be reviewed for improper dependencies or
  misplaced logic.

## Consequences

- Architectural layering violations become visible and measurable.
- Encourages keeping business logic away from volatile entry points.
- Supports automation and CI enforcement of architectural rules.
- Helps prioritize refactoring efforts toward unstable domains.
- Enables metrics such as:
  - distance distribution across domains
  - correlation between distance and defect frequency
  - trends in architectural erosion over time
