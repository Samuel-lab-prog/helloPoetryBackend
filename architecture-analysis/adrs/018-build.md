# ADR-018: Reproducible and Deterministic Builds

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Reliable builds are essential for consistent deployments, reproducible test
results, and predictable development workflows. Non-deterministic builds lead to
difficult-to-debug failures and undermine confidence in CI and production
artifacts.

A standardized build process ensures that artifacts generated locally and in CI
are equivalent and verifiable.

To guarantee reliability and repeatability, builds must be deterministic and
fully automated.

## Decision

- The project must have a single, standardized build process.
- Builds must be reproducible across environments.
- The CI pipeline **must fail** if the build process fails.
- Build steps must:
  - avoid implicit environment dependencies,
  - use locked dependency versions,
  - produce consistent outputs given the same inputs.

## Consequences

- Increases confidence in deployment artifacts.
- Reduces environment-specific bugs.
- Simplifies onboarding and local development setup.
- May require stricter dependency and tooling management.
