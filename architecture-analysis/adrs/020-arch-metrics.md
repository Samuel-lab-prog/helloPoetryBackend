# ADR-020: Architecture Metrics as First-Class Signals

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

As systems scale, qualitative assessments of architecture become insufficient.
Without measurable signals, architectural degradation often goes unnoticed until
it becomes costly to fix.

Metrics such as domain size, dependency structure, test coverage, and distance
from entry points provide concrete insight into architectural health. While
metrics are not absolute measures of quality, they serve as valuable indicators
for risk and trend analysis.

To enable informed architectural decisions, these metrics must be treated as
first-class signals rather than auxiliary data.

## Decision

- Architectural metrics are considered **first-class inputs** to decision
  making.
- Metrics must be:
  - collected automatically,
  - reproducible,
  - evaluated per domain when applicable.
- Metrics are used to:
  - detect architectural drift,
  - prioritize refactoring,
  - guide system evolution.
- Metrics are signals, not guarantees, and must be interpreted in context.

## Consequences

- Architectural health becomes observable and trackable over time.
- Enables data-driven refactoring and design decisions.
- Prevents reliance on subjective architectural judgments.
- Supports long-term sustainability of the system.
- May require initial investment in tooling and metric collection.
