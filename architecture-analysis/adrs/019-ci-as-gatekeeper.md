# ADR-019: CI as Architectural Gatekeeper

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Architectural rules that rely solely on documentation or code review are fragile
and tend to erode over time. As the codebase grows and more contributors join,
implicit rules become inconsistently applied or silently bypassed.

Continuous Integration (CI) is the only place where architectural constraints
can be enforced uniformly, objectively, and without social friction.

Given that many architectural decisions in this system are measurable and
machine-verifiable, CI must act as the primary enforcement mechanism for
architectural integrity.

## Decision

- The CI pipeline is the **authoritative gatekeeper** of architectural rules.
- All architectural checks must be enforced automatically in CI.
- A pull request **must not be merged** if any architectural rule fails.
- Architectural checks enforced by CI include, but are not limited to:
  - dependency rules,
  - domain isolation,
  - circular dependency detection,
  - testability thresholds,
  - linting, formatting, and build validation.

Manual review **must not** override CI failures related to architecture.

## Consequences

- Architectural rules become objective and non-negotiable.
- Reduces reliance on tribal knowledge and manual enforcement.
- Prevents gradual architectural decay.
- Increases trust in CI as a source of truth.
- May require initial effort to implement and maintain CI checks for all
  relevant architectural rules.
