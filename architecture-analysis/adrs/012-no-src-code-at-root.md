# ADR-011: Valid Root Namespace Enforcement

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Root namespaces define the top-level architectural structure of the codebase.
Allowing arbitrary or inconsistent root namespaces makes dependency analysis,
tooling, and architectural reasoning unreliable.

To enable automation and enforce architectural rules, root namespaces must be
strictly controlled and validated.

## Decision

- Only explicitly approved root namespaces are allowed.
- Any source file using an invalid root namespace is considered a violation.
- The CI pipeline **must fail** when invalid root namespaces are detected.

This rule is enforced through static analysis of imports and file paths.

## Consequences

- Architectural structure becomes machine-verifiable.
- Prevents namespace sprawl and ad-hoc layering.
- Improves reliability of architectural metrics and tooling.
- Some initial effort is required to refactor existing code to conform to valid
  namespaces.
