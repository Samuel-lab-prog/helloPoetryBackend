# ADR-016: Mandatory Linting Enforcement

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Consistent code quality and architectural discipline require automated
validation beyond human review. Linting enables early detection of
anti-patterns, unsafe constructs, and deviations from agreed coding and
architectural standards.

Without enforced linting, inconsistencies accumulate over time, leading to
increased maintenance cost and reduced readability across domains.

To ensure uniform code quality and prevent architectural erosion, linting must
be mandatory and enforced automatically.

## Decision

- All source code must pass linting checks.
- Linting is part of the CI pipeline and **must block merges** on failure.
- Lint rules must include:
  - code quality rules,
  - architectural constraints when applicable,
  - safety-related checks.
- Disabling lint rules inline is discouraged and must be explicitly justified.

## Consequences

- Improves overall code consistency and readability.
- Prevents common classes of bugs and anti-patterns.
- Reduces cognitive load during code review.
- May introduce friction when rules are initially adopted.
- Requires ongoing maintenance of lint rules to stay relevant and effective.
