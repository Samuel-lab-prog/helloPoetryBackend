# ADR-007: Domain Testability Classification

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Domains encapsulate business rules and invariants and are expected to evolve
over time as requirements change. However, not all behavior is exercised through
internal unit tests alone, since a significant portion of validation may occur
through external tests such as integration, contract, or end-to-end tests.

Pure coverage numbers, when interpreted without context, can be misleading. Very
high coverage is not always necessary or cost-effective, especially when domains
are heavily exercised through external boundaries.

At the same time, extremely low test coverage is a strong signal of fragile
domains, unclear responsibilities, or logic that is difficult to validate and
safely evolve.

To balance enforcement with pragmatism, domains must be classified according to
minimum testability thresholds, with clear consequences for each level.

## Decision

Each domain must be classified according to its internal test coverage:

- **FAIL**
  - Less than **30%** test coverage.
  - This is considered unacceptable.
  - The CI pipeline **must fail** when a domain falls into this category.

- **OK**
  - Coverage between **30% and 50%**.
  - Indicates minimal but insufficient confidence.
  - Allowed temporarily, but improvement is encouraged.

- **GOOD**
  - Coverage above **50%**.
  - Indicates a healthy and testable domain.

Additional rules:

- Coverage is measured **per domain**, not globally.
- External tests (integration, E2E, contract tests) are acknowledged as
  complementary but **do not replace** the need for internal domain tests.
- Domains classified as FAIL must not be extended with new behavior until they
  reach at least the OK level.

## Consequences

- CI enforces a clear lower bound on domain testability.
- Coverage numbers are used as signals, not absolute quality metrics.
- Teams retain flexibility to rely on external testing strategies.
- Low-testability domains are surfaced early and explicitly.
- Enables architectural metrics such as:
  - number of FAIL / OK / GOOD domains
  - testability trends per domain over time
  - correlation between domain size and coverage
