# ADR-006: Mandatory Tests for Use Cases

## Status

Accepted at 2026-02-08

## Context

Use-cases represent the core application behavior and orchestrate domain logic,
policies, and interactions with external systems through ports. They encode
business rules that are critical to system correctness and stability.

Because use-cases sit at the center of the architecture, regressions or
unintended changes in this layer tend to have high impact and are often not
immediately visible through adapter-level or end-to-end tests alone.

Relying on indirect coverage (e.g. controller tests, integration tests, or
manual verification) makes it difficult to reason about correctness, change
amplification, and behavior drift over time.

To preserve architectural integrity and enable safe evolution of the system,
use-cases must be explicitly tested in isolation.

## Decision

- Every use-case **must** have a corresponding test file.
- A use-case without tests is considered **incomplete** and must not be merged.
- Use-case tests must:
  - Exercise the use-case directly (no entry points or adapters involved).
  - Mock or fake external dependencies via ports.
  - Validate both successful paths and relevant failure scenarios.
- Test files must live alongside or in a predictable location relative to the
  use-case implementation to ensure discoverability and tooling support.

## Consequences

- Writing new use-cases has a slightly higher upfront cost.
- Test coverage of business behavior becomes explicit and intentional.
- Refactoring use-cases is safer and faster due to immediate feedback.
- Architectural violations (e.g. hidden dependencies, improper coupling) are
  more easily detected during test setup.
- Enables metrics such as:
  - use-cases without tests
  - average behavioral coverage per domain
  - change amplification localized to the use-case layer
