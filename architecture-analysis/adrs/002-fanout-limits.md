# ADR-002: Fan-out limits

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Modules with high fan-out tend to accumulate responsibilities and create
implicit coupling, increasing the cost of change.

Static analysis revealed that most modules stay below 10 direct dependencies.

## Decision

Fan-out thresholds are defined as:

- OK: ≤ 7 dependencies
- WARN: 8–12 dependencies
- FAIL: > 12 dependencies

Modules classified as FAIL will break the CI pipeline.

## Consequences

- Forces early refactoring of highly coupled modules.
- Prevents gradual architectural erosion.
- Requires explicit exceptions for entry-point modules.
